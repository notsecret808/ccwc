ccwc - word, line, character, and byte count tool

Usage:
  ccwc [OPTION]... [FILE]

Options:
  -c        Print the byte count
  -l        Print the line count
  -w        Print the word count
  -m        Print the character count
  -h, --help
            Show this help message and exit

Notes:
  - If no FILE is specified, ccwc reads from standard input.
  - Options can be combined. For example:
        ccwc -l -w file.txt
    will print both line and word counts.
  - If no option is given, ccwc defaults to printing line, word, and byte counts.

Examples:
  ccwc file.txt          # print line, word, and byte counts for file.txt
  ccwc -l file.txt       # print only line count
  echo "hello world" | ccwc -w
                         # count words from standard input
